  <h1> HTML </h1>

    <h2>HTML Boilerplate</h2>
      <p>It is the basic structure or boilerplate that needs to be set up before anything
        useful can be done</p>


      <h3> DOCTYPE </h3>
        <p>It is very important and tells the browser it's looking at an html file.
          It also informs the browser what version of HTML it should use to render the
          document.</p>
        <p> &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; </p>

      <h3> HTML Tag </h3>
        <p>This is the root element of the document. Meaning that every other element of the
          document is a descendant of it.</p>

        <p> &lt;html&gt; &lt;/html&gt;</p>

      <h3> Head Element </h3>
        <p>Head is where the extra information goes it does not show on the screen but it is
          essential in getting things to work properly.</p>
        <p> &lt;head&gt; &lt;/head&gt; </p>

          <h4>Title Element</h4>
            <p>This shows up in the tab; it is the title that shows up in the google search.
              It is always put as a descendant/child of the head element.</p>
            <p> &lt;title&gt; I am a title that will show in the browser tab. &lt;/title&gt; </p>

          <h4>Charset Meta Element</h4>
            <p>Tells the browser what character set (or kinda like what type of alphabet)
              you are using for the page. It is also always put as a descendant/child
              of the head element. </p>
            <p> &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt; </p>

      <h3> Body Element </h3>
        <p>Body is where all the information goes. Everything you want to show up on the screen
          or your page goes here.
        <p> &lt;body&gt; &lt;/body&gt; </p>


    <h2>HTML Texts</h2>


      <h3> Paragraphs </h3>
        <p>Paragraphs has &lt;p&gt; and &lt;/p&gt; as opening and closing tags, respectively.</p>
        <p>If you want to make two paragraphs, you have to put each paragraphs in separate tags
          with their own opening and closing paragraph tags.</p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p> &lt;p&gt; This is my first paragraph. &lt;/p&gt; </p>
        <p> &lt;p&gt; This is my second paragraph. &lt;/p&gt; </p>
        <p>Which will render in your page as:</p>
        <p>This is my first paragraph.</p>
        <p>This is my second paragraph.</p>
        <p>Instead of: </p>
        <p>This is my first paragraph.This is my second paragraph.</p>
        <p>When you code it under one paragraph tag pair.</p>
        <p> i.e.</p>
        <p> &lt;p&gt; This is my first paragraph.  </p>
        <p> This is my second paragraph. &lt;/p&gt; </p>

      <h3> Headings </h3>
        <p>Headings are different than texts in HTML. Headings are written in bold with different
          sizes.</p>
        <p>There are six different headings that varies in importance. h1 is the highest level
          and is therefore the biggest and has higher importance. h6 is the lowest level which is
          therefore the smallest in the headings.</p>

          <h1>&lt;h1&gt; Heading 1 &lt;/h1&gt;</h1>
          <h2>&lt;h2&gt; Heading 2 &lt;/h2&gt;</h2>
          <h3>&lt;h3&gt; Heading 3 &lt;/h3&gt;</h3>
          <h4>&lt;h4&gt; Heading 4 &lt;/h4&gt;</h4>
          <h5>&lt;h5&gt; Heading 5 &lt;/h5&gt;</h5>
          <h6>&lt;h6&gt; Heading 6 &lt;/h6&gt;</h6>

      <h3> Strong Element </h3>
        <p>It is used for making texts bold. </p>
        <p>Sometimes, when googling how to make texts bold in html, you might see answers
          to use &lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;. It does make texts bold visually, the difference is,
          with web design, we have to give emphasis or importance to some texts for
          accessibility (such as word search in google or text/screen readers)
          &lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt; will give the same effect to the text visually but for
          visually impaired who uses text readers, the text reader will just read it the
          same way it reads other texts. With &lt;strong&gt;; the tone of voice on the
          screen reader will change to communicate the importance of the text. </p>
        <p>&lt;strong&gt; <strong>We are texts wrapped in strong tags to make us bold.</strong>
          &lt;/strong&gt; </p>

      <h3> Emphasis Element </h3>
        <p>It is used for making texts italic. </p>
        <p>Just like with strong element, sometimes, when googling how to make texts italic
          in html, you will see a different answer which is to use &lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;
          to make the texts visually italic. But as with the strong element,
          it is better to use the emphasis element instead of its shorter counterpart to give
          the highlighted text the importance it needs and for the screen reader to communicate
          it properly to those who uses it.
        <p>&lt;em&gt; <em>We are texts wrapped in emphasis tags to make us italic.</em>
          &lt;/em&gt; </p>

        <p> &lt;strong&gt; &lt;em&gt; <strong><em> We are italicized bold texts made by
         the combination of strong and emphasis element </em></strong> &lt;/em&gt;
         &lt;/strong&gt; </p>

      <h3> Nesting and Indentation </h3>
        <p>We need to indent any elements that are within other elements. This is known
          as nesting elements.</p>
        <p>When we nest elements within other elements, we create a parent and child
          relationship between them. The nested elements are the children and the element
          they are nested within is the parent.</p>
        <p>For example in the following example the body element is the parent and the
          paragraph is the child.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 10px">&lt;html&gt;</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 30px"> &lt;head&gt;</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 30px"> &lt;/head&gt;</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 30px"> &lt;body&gt;</p>
              <p style="margin-left: 50px">   &lt;p&gt; We are an example. &lt;/p&gt;</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 30px"> &lt;/body&gt;</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 10px">&lt;/html&gt;</p>

      <h3> HTML Comments </h3>
        <p>Comments are not visible to the browser.</p>
        <p> &lt;!-- and --&gt; </>


    <h2> Lists </h2>


      <h3> Unordered Lists </h3>
        <p>When you need a list of items but the order does not matter.</p>
        <p>Unordered lists are created using &lt;ul&gt; element and each item within the list
          is created using &lt;li&gt;.</p>
        <p>In an unordered list, each item starts with a bullet point.</p>
        <p>In code:</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30px"> &lt;ul&gt;</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 50px">   &lt;li&gt; Item 1 &lt;/li&gt;</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 50px">   &lt;li&gt; Item 2 &lt;/li&gt;</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 50px">   &lt;li&gt; Item 3 &lt;/li&gt;</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30px"> &lt;/ul&gt;</p>
        <p>In browser:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Item 1</li>
            <li>Item 2</li>
            <li>Item 3</li>
          </ul>

      <h3> Ordered Lists </h3>
        <p>Used when the order of the list of items does matter.</p>
        <p>Unordered lists are created using &lt;ol&gt; element and each item within the list
          is created using &lt;li&gt;. However, each item starts with a number.</p>
        <p>In code:</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30px"> &lt;ol&gt;</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 50px">   &lt;li&gt; Item 1 &lt;/li&gt;</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 50px">   &lt;li&gt; Item 2 &lt;/li&gt;</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 50px">   &lt;li&gt; Item 3 &lt;/li&gt;</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 30px"> &lt;/ol&gt;</p>
        <p>In browser:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Item 1</li>
            <li>Item 2</li>
            <li>Item 3</li>
          </ol>


    <h2> Links and Images </h2>


      <h3> Anchor Elements </h3>
        <p>Is the tag used for making texts a hyperlink text. It does not work by itself, though.
          You have to add an href with the link for it to work.</p>
        <p>If you are going to anchor an external link, you will have to put http:// in front
          of the link, otherwise, when you clink the hypertext, it will just think that the link
          is a name of an html file that exists in you main website's folder.</p>
        <p>Itâ€™s worth noting you can use anchor tags link to any kind of resource on the internet,
          not just other HTML documents. You can link to videos, pdf files, images, and so on,
          but for the most part, you will be linking to other HTML documents.
        <p> &lt;a&gt; &lt;/g&gt; </p>

        <p>Examples:</p>

          <p>In code:</p>
            <p> &lt;a href="http://www.google.com"&gt; click me to google &lt;/a&gt; </p>
          <p>In browser:</p>
            <a href="http://www.google.com">click me to google</a>

          <p>In code:</p>
            <p> &lt;a href="index.html"&gt; click me to go home &lt;/a&gt; </p>
          <p>In browser:</p>
            <a href="index.html">click me to go home</a>

        <p>In the first example, when you click the hyperlinked text "click me  to google",
          it will take you to the homepage of google. In the second example, when you click
          "click me to go home", it will take you to the homepage of this site.</p>
        <p>This is the difference when linking an external link and a file within your folder,
          In the first one, since it is an external link, putting http:// in front of the url
          is essential  because if you dont, the browser will think you are trying to link a
          file within your site folder named www.google.com and try to find it there instead
          of the famous search engine google. </p>

      <h3> Absolute and Relative Links </h3>
        <p>Generally, there are two kinds of links we will create:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Links to pages on other websites on the internet.</li>
          <li>Links to pages located on our own websites.</li>
        </ol>

          <h4>Absolute Links</h4>
            <p>Links to pages on other websites on the internet are called absolute links.
              A typical absolute link will be made up of the following parts:</p>
            <p>protocol://domain/path</p>
            <p>An absolute link will always contain the protocol and domain of the
              destination.</p>
            <p>The hyperlink created earlier under anchor elements topic which leads to the
              homepage of google is an example of absolute link. It contains the protocol
              (https:// (?)) and domain (www.google.com).</p>

          <h4>Relative Links</h4>
            <p>Links to other pages within our own website are called relative links.
              Relative links do not include the domain name, since it is another page on
              the same site, it assumes the domain name will be the same as the page we
              created the link on.
              Relative links only include the file path to the other page, relative to the
              page you are creating the link on.</p>
            <p>The previous example where the hyperlink text leads to the homepage is an
              example of a relative link. The homepage is just within this site and the
              index.html file which it is in is in the same folder that this filecode is in.</p>

      <h3> Images </h3>
        <p>Putting an image in your webpage is kinda like linking sites; you have to put the
          image's web address in the src (source).</p>
        <p>With image sources, if you put the wrong link or file name, it will show up as the
          broken image icon in your webpage.</p>
        <p>The text you put in alt (alternative) attribute is the text that shows up when the
          image did not load because of wrong link that was put in the src or bad internet
          connection. It's also for people who uses text reader for those with vision
          impairment. Text or screen readers reads the text in a page and when it gets to the
          image, it will read the alt text. Sometime's it is also used by people to cheat
          systems a little bit for search engine optimization, but if you are doing it correctly,
          alt should be a description of the image you are linking.</p>

        <p>Examples:</p>
          <p>In code:</p>
            <p> &lt;img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/sunset-quotes-21-1586531574.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.752xh;0,0.0601xh&resize=768:*"
              alt="a beautiful sunset by the beach"&gt; </p>
          <p>In browser:</p>
            <img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/sunset-quotes-21-1586531574.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.752xh;0,0.0601xh&resize=768:*"
              alt="a beautiful sunset by the beach">

          <p>In code:</p>
            <p> &lt;img src="img/hamster.png" alt="cute hamster cartoon that is standing up.
              it is partly orange and has pink cheek blush."&gt; </p>
          <p>In browser:</p>
            <img src="img/hamster.png" alt="cute hamster
              cartoon that is standing up. it is partly orange and has pink cheek blush.">

        <p>The first one is an image that has an absolute link. The second one, which is a
          hamster, is an example of a relative link.</p>
